The project simulated complex neuronal dynamics, observing the stabilisation of large networks 
of neurons using different models of inhibitory action. I then analysed connectivity patterns
in the network and compared these to experimental data.

The files containing the core of the stabilisation procedure are:
utilities.cpp
optimise.cpp
generateW.cpp

These together generate an initial synaptic weight matrix, and then stabilise the matrix using an iterative technique,
varying the inhibitory connection locations and strengths to match the excitatory network. 

*.m files contain scripts for analysing the output of trials involving several runs of the stabilisation procedure. 
*_test.cpp files were used for testing of the functions in the core *.cpp files.

I can email a copy of the final report for the project (my Master's year project) if you want more detail on the 
methods, results and conclusions of the investigation.
